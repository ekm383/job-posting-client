JOB POSTING DESIGN DOCUMENT

BRIEF:
The goal of this document is to highlight the core functionality of the Job Posting web application. Users can register, create posts, delete posts, and update posts through protected routes. Public users can view the landing page and register new accounts.

TOOLS:

- Authentication: Firebase

  - Firebase Authentication provides backend services, easy-to-use SDKs, and ready-made UI libraries to authenticate users to your app. It supports authentication using passwords, phone numbers, popular federated identity providers like Google, Facebook and Twitter, and more.

- Database: MongoDB Atlas

  - MongoDB Atlas is a multi-cloud database service by the same people that build MongoDB. Atlas simplifies deploying and managing your databases while offering the versatility you need to build resilient and performant global applications on the cloud providers of your choice.

- Middleware: Node/Express

  - Node.js is an open source server environment that can generate dynamic page content, create, open, red, write, delete, and close files on the server, collect data, and also add, delete, and modify data in the database
  - Express is a minimal and flexible Node.js web application framework that provides a robust set of features for web and mobile applications.

- Frontend: React

  - React is a Javascript library for building user interfaces

- State Management: Redux

  - Redux is a predictable state container for JavaScript apps. It helps you write applications that behave consistently, run in different environments (client, server, and native), and are easy to test. On top of that, it provides a great developer experience, such as live code editing combined with a time traveling debugger.

- Forms: Material UI

  - Material-UI is a library that allows us to import and use different components to create a user interface in our React applications.

- Stylesheet: styled-components
  - Styled-components is a library built for React and React Native developers. It allows you to use component-level styles in your applications. Styled-components leverage a mixture of JavaScript and CSS using a technique called CSS-in-JS.
